        "Normal hair loss, often referred to as shedding, is a natural and cyclical process that occurs as part of the hair growth cycle. This cycle consists of several phases, including the anagen phase, where active hair growth takes place; the catagen phase, a transitional period; and the telogen phase, a resting stage during which shedding occurs. The exogen phase is marked by the shedding of old hair, leading to the initiation of a new hair growth cycle.",

    "description": "Stage 1 of hair loss, often referred to as the initial phase or early onset, is characterized by subtle changes in the hair growth cycle. During this stage, individuals may experience a gradual increase in hair shedding, which can be considered within the normal range. The anagen phase may become shorter, leading to a reduction in the length of the hair. While these changes may not be immediately noticeable, individuals may observe a slight thinning of the hair."

    "description": "In Stage 2 of hair loss, individuals typically experience a progression of the condition, with more noticeable changes in hair density and thickness. This stage is marked by a continuation of increased hair shedding and thinning, making the scalp more visible. The anagen phase further shortens, leading to reduced hair length and slower growth. Hair follicles may start to miniaturize, producing finer and weaker strands.\n\n"
"During Stage 2, individuals may observe widening part lines, increased scalp visibility, and a reduction in overall hair volume.",

  "stage 3": {

    "imageAddr": "assets/images/Stage3.png",
    "description": "In Stage 3 of hair loss, individuals witness advanced thinning and increased scalp visibility. Hair follicles continue to miniaturize, leading to a noticeable reduction in hair density. The widening of part lines and increased scalp exposure become more pronounced. Seeking consultation with a healthcare professional or dermatologist is crucial at this stage for a thorough assessment and personalized treatment recommendations to address hair loss concerns.",

    "description": "Baldness represents the advanced stage of hair loss, characterized by the complete or near-complete absence of hair on the scalp. At this stage, individuals often face challenges associated with the psychological and emotional impact of significant hair loss. The smooth and shiny appearance of the scalp is a result of the absence of viable hair follicles. Seeking consultation with a qualified dermatologist or hair restoration specialist is crucial to explore available options."
